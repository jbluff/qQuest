Deleting, done via an Item attribute
    This is fine-- we'll overwrite game.currentObjects at each level

Add a bunch of items and stuff.

Create directions for player

Directional spells/casts, etc.

Game 
- saving
- loading
- menu

Unify image reference stuff, get rid of Assets structure

Add new AIs

Add level generation (lol, huge task)
- both procedural and from file

Replace "seen but not visible" w/ transparent overlay

Make fancier unseen fog of war
