# qQuest

A silly game for me to practice some slightly more involved Python and OOP concepts.  At present (12/2019), this is far more of an engine than a game, lacking much in the way of actual content.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.6+
- numpy
- pygame (graphics)
- tcod (field of view math)
- dill (saving)
